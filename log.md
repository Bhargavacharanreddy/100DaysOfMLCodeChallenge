## Day 0 : July 9 , 2018
**Today's Progress :**  .

**Thoughts :** 

**Link of Work:** 

## Day 1 : July 10 , 2018
**Today's Progress :**  This is my first day of the challenge. Right now I am learning the basics of Neural Network Programming.As a part of this today I have learned about binary classification problem, Logistic Regression , Logistic Regression Cost Function and Gradient Descent. 

**Thoughts :** Logistic Regression is used for Binary classification problems.It's all about Linear algebra.

**Link of Work:**  [Notes](https://github.com/cherry324/100DaysOfMLCodeChallenge/tree/master/notesDay1)I have written notes about the concepts which I have learnt today. 

## Day 2 : July 11 , 2018
**Today's Progress :**  Learned about Computation Graph, Derivatives with a computation graph, Logistic Regression derivatives. 

**Thoughts :** Mathematics is everything

**Link of Work:**  [Notes](https://github.com/cherry324/100DaysOfMLCodeChallenge/tree/master/notesDay2)I have written rough notes about the concepts which I have learnt today. 

## Day 3 : July 12 , 2018
**Today's Progress :**  Implemented Handwritten Digits Recognition in python using scikit-learn. Used MNIST dataset.Read about Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib libraries in python. 

**Thoughts :** Scikit learn is a very useful package.

**Link of Work:**  [code](https://github.com/cherry324/100DaysOfMLCodeChallenge/tree/master/Day3) Code is written in python.

## Day 4 : July 13 , 2018
**Today's Progress :**  Today I have spent time to know about TensorFlow.Installed it and did the basic programs.

**Thoughts :** It is mainly used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.

## Day 5 : July 14 , 2018
**Today's Progress :**  Today I have learnt about Image classification using Tensorflow by Watching a Video on youtube.

## Day 6 : July 15 , 2018
**Today's Progress :**  Today I have learnt about Neural Network, Neural Network Representation, Activation Functions and Gradient Descent for Neural Network.

**Thoughts :** I should spend more time on these concepts.

## Day 7 : July 16 , 2018
**Today's Progress :**  Today I have gone through the topics of  Regularization,Why Regularization reduces overfitting and dropout Regularization.

**Thoughts :** I should spend more time on these concepts.

## Day 8 : July 17 , 2018
**Today's Progress :**  Today I have learned about forward and Backward Propagation in Neural Network.

**Thoughts :** Next week I will try to implement algorithms (Forward and Backward) Propagation.

## Day 9 : July 18 , 2018
**Today's Progress :**  Today I have learnt about hyper-parameters vs parameters in Neural Network.

**Thoughts :** Parameters plays a great role.

## Day 10-11 : July 19,20 , 2018
**Today's Progress :**  I have enrolled in Specialization course on Coursera.

**Thoughts :** Previously I was not learning concepts in an organized manner so Now I have decided to take a specialization course.

## Day 1 : July 24th, 2018
**Today's Progress :**  Today I have started with Course1 ( Neural Networks and Deep Learning ) of Coursera's Deep learning Specialization Track. 

**Thoughts :** I thought by posting what I learnt will help me understand well about the concepts.

**Link of Work:** I have written a post about "What is a neural network?"  [Post link](https://cherrythecoder.wordpress.com/2018/07/24/what-is-a-neural-network/) 

## Day 2 : July 25th, 2018
**Today's Progress :**  Today I have finished the week1 ( Neural Networks and Deep Learning ) of Coursera's Deep learning Specialization Track. 

**Thoughts :** I thought by posting what I learnt will help me understand well about the concepts.

**Link of Work:** I have publised a post   [Post link](https://cherrythecoder.wordpress.com/2018/07/26/day2-100daysofmlcode-challenge/)
