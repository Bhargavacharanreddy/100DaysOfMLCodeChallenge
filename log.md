# 100 Days of Machine Learning Code Challenge Log

## Day 0 : July 9 , 2018
**Today's Progress :**  .

**Thoughts :** 

**Link of Work:** 

## Day 1 : July 10 , 2018
**Today's Progress :**  This is my first day of the challenge. Right now I am learning the basics of Neural Network Programming.As a part of this today I have learned about binary classification problem, Logistic Regression , Logistic Regression Cost Function and Gradient Descent. 

**Thoughts :** Logistic Regression is used for Binary classification problems.It's all about Linear algebra.

**Link of Work:**  [Notes](https://github.com/cherry324/100DaysOfMLCodeChallenge/tree/master/notesDay1)I have written notes about the concepts which I have learnt today. 

## Day 2 : July 11 , 2018
**Today's Progress :**  Learned about Computation Graph, Derivatives with a computation graph, Logistic Regression derivatives. 

**Thoughts :** Mathematics is everything

**Link of Work:**  [Notes](https://github.com/cherry324/100DaysOfMLCodeChallenge/tree/master/notesDay2)I have written rough notes about the concepts which I have learnt today. 

## Day 3 : July 12 , 2018
**Today's Progress :**  Implemented Handwritten Digits Recognition in python using scikit-learn. Used MNIST dataset.Read about Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib libraries in python. 

**Thoughts :** Scikit learn is a very useful package.

**Link of Work:**  [code](https://github.com/cherry324/100DaysOfMLCodeChallenge/tree/master/Day3) Code is written in python.

## Day 4 : July 13 , 2018
**Today's Progress :**  Today I have spent time to know about TensorFlow.Installed it and did the basic programs.

**Thoughts :** It is mainly used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.
