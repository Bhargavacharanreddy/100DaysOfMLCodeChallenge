## Day 1 : July 10 , 2018
**Today's Progress :**  This is my first day of the challenge. Right now I am learning the basics of Neural Network Programming.As a part of this today I have learned about binary classification problem, Logistic Regression , Logistic Regression Cost Function and Gradient Descent. 

**Thoughts :** Logistic Regression is used for Binary classification problems.It's all about Linear algebra.

**Link of Work:**  [Notes](https://github.com/cherry324/100DaysOfMLCodeChallenge/tree/master/notesDay1)I have written notes about the concepts which I have learnt today.
